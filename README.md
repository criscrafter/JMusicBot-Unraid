IMPORTANT! I Switched Docker source Image from original [Jagrosh/Musicbot](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/) to [SeVile/MusicBot](https://github.com/SeVile/MusicBot), since Jagrosh doesn't seem to care about updating the bot anymore and Youtube Playback has been broken for months.
SeVile has basically a mirror of Jagrosh's bot, but with the current Youtube Fetcher.

I am not the developer of any of the Docker Containers I release!
I am only dockerizing the containers in a Unraid Comunity Applications compatible format.

If you like the work I do, consider donating through my paypal link or my ko-fi link, but also always consider donating to the people who created the software and did the actual hard work! :)
